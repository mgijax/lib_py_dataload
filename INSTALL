There is no Install script for this product.  


At run time, some of these  python libraries  must be able to find
these standard MGI libraries:
	  mgdlib


The python libraries  assume that the PYTHONPATH environment variable
will include the path to the directory for this MGI-standard library. 


INSTALLATION STEPS:
	1. Export from CVS most recent (or desired) version or copy an 
	   exported copy of the directory to its final installation
	   directory.
